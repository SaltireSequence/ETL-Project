My objective from my transformation was to simply bring order and consistency to my data. I struggled initially to write the code to repetitively remove white space from different columns, however following alot of trial-and-error, I was able to write a simple for loop that iteracted through my DataFrame and (by referencing a list containing correct column headers) and replace the white space, with correct vaules.
